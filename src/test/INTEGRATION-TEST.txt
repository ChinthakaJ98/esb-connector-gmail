2.Extract the certificate from browser(Mozilla Firefox) by navigating to url(Eg:- https://mail.google.com/)
        Add the certificate obtained to "<EI_HOME>/repository/resources/security" folder and "{GMAIL_HOME}/src/test/resources/keystores/products".

               "<GMAIL_HOME>/src/test/resources/keystores/products"

           		Navigate to the above location from command prompt and execute 'keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore wso2carbon.jks -alias "gmail"' in command line to import gmail certificate in to keystore. Give "wso2carbon" as password.
                    NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from gmail with  the extension, change it accordingly. Remove the copied certificate.

           	   "WSO2-EI-6.2.0/repository/resources/security"

           		Navigate to the above location from command prompt and execute 'keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore client-truststore.jks -alias "gmail"' in command line to import gmail certificate in to keystore. Give "wso2carbon" as password.
